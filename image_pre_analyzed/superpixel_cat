Requirement of the superpixels:
1. Homogeneity: Pixels of a given SP should present similar colors or gray levels
2. Connected partition: Each SP is made of a single connected component; SP do not overlap
3. Adherence to object boundaries: Obejct boundaries should be included in SP boundaries
4. Regularity: SP should form a regular pattern on the image. This property is ofen desirable as it makes the SP more
convenient to use for subsequent analysis steps.
